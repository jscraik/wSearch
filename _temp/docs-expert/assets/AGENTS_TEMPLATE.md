## Scope
This doc defines the boundaries for agent work in this repo: what is in scope, what is out of scope, and which decisions require approval.

## Working agreements
- Ask before changing public APIs, schemas, or user-visible copy.
- Follow existing code style and lint rules; do not introduce new tooling without approval.
- Prefer small, verifiable changes with tests or manual verification steps.
- Document unknowns explicitly rather than guessing.
- Do not add dependencies without explicit approval.
- Call out security or privacy implications in the final response.
- Provide a rollback plan for risky changes.
